# Research Plan

### Data Processing
- [ ] Filter data to only look at the Atlantic Ocean
- [ ] Average over winter (Dec - March)

### Data Analysis
- [ ] Calculate mean of SST
- [ ] Calculate standard deviation of SST
- [ ] Examine long-term trends in SST using rolling mean
- [ ] Correlate SST with the NAO Index

### Visualize Data
- [ ] Contour plot of mean SST
- [ ] Contour plot of SST correlated with the NAO index
